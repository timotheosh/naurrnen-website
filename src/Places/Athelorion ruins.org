√Åyliaremma Elves made an ancient [[file:../History/First Era.org][Amearen]] ruin, now known as the Athelorion ruins, their capital city named Aeritha. [[file:../Characters/Bayetti Falasha.org][Bayetti Falasha]]'s [[file:../Books/The Ancient Ones.org]["The Ancient Ones"]] speaks much of the ancient city, and is believed to have encrypted much of the ancient Elven knowledge of the Amearans in her poetic stanzas. There is a rumor that there is a vast transporter within that can leeds to the place of the dead.
