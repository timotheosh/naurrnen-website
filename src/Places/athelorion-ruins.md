Áyliaremma Elves made an ancient [Amearen](../History/First Era.md) ruin, now known as the Athelorion ruins, their capital city named Aeritha. [Bayetti Falasha](../Characters/Bayetti Falasha.md)&rsquo;s [&ldquo;The Ancient Ones&rdquo;](../Books/The Ancient Ones.md) speaks much of the ancient city, and is believed to have encrypted much of the ancient Elven knowledge of the Amearans in her poetic stanzas. There is a rumor that there is a vast transporter within that can leeds to the place of the dead.
