In the heart of a mysterious universe lies Naurrnen, a world veiled in layers of history, myth, and enigma. Its past unfolds across three distinct eras, each contributing its unique imprints to the civilization's intricate tapestry. The first era is shrouded in antiquity, ruled by the mythical Amearans—beings of lore whose existence is more speculation than fact. Yet, the ruins and artifacts they supposedly left behind confound scholars to this day. In reality, these remnants belonged to a super-advanced society that vanished long before Naurrnen's present-day inhabitants came to be, but the populace remains ignorant of these sci-fi roots.

The second era marks the dominion of the Elves, specifically the Hallashim elves, who imposed their rule across Naurrnen's expanse. A unified empire materialized under their governance, albeit at the cost of subjugating other races and elves not of the Hallashim lineage. But empires, however mighty, have their breaking points. A revolution led by the Naethanors heralded the fall of the Elven empire and gave birth to the third era—a time of unprecedented change and enlightenment.

With the rise of the human empire established by the Naethanors, Naurrnen entered a new chapter defined by peace, tolerance, and commerce. The Naethanor rule fostered an ethos of liberty and inter-racial harmony, knitting together the world's disparate cultures through trade and mutual respect. A semblance of unity now prevails, but the ancient ruins and age-old myths still beckon, promising untold secrets and inviting countless adventurers to unearth the hidden layers of Naurrnen's past.

In this realm, where the ancient coexists with the present, the quests for knowledge and power are never-ending. Naurrnen remains a fertile ground for explorers, scholars, and dreamers alike, each seeking to decode the riddles of a history half-imagined and half-real.
