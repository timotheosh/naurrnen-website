1. From the ancient tongue (similar to Latin), meaning "blue".
2. Color is silver with streaks of blue light
3. Primary source of magicka
4. Primary source of energy
5. Is mined
6. Sometimes used as currency, but since it is generally softer than gold, it is not ideal for coinage.

Saruleum is a soft metal and is an extremely inefficient energy source for magic, but an extremely efficient source of energy for mechanical contraptions. This means that cultures will view the resource as scarce, and better used for non-magical applications. Of course, the wizard guilds will want an unlimited supply of the resource so they can explore and learn more about magic.

A hard and heavy metal. Can be used as armor but is too heavy to make full suits of armor. Usually a plate of the metal will be used in conjunction with steel. It is most commonly used in constructs for production that need sturdy materials in order to function.
