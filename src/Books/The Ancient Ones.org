Beneath the starry skies, their secrets softly gleam,
The Amearans, a faded memory it seems.
In Valinor they dwelt, where light forever beams,
AiquentalÃ«'s song, in realms of wonder, dreams.

Amongst the ancient trees, their voices sweetly soar,
In the twilight's grace, where mysteries they bore.
Melmindar's haven, a land forevermore,
The Amearans' tale, in whispers we explore.

Deep within Athalorion's core, they did reside,
A Descension Chalice, where secrets did abide.
Unlock its mysteries, with singing as your guide,
In ancient depths, where wonders yet inside.

In hushed tones, the words long lost to time,
Whispered 'neath the stars, in rhythm and rhyme.
With gentle echo, they beckon, so sublime,
To realms unknown, through portals we'll climb.
