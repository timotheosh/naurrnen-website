# Lament of the Divided Path

> In shadows deep, where whispers dwell,
> Luthien walked, her tale to tell.
> With heart so pure, intentions bright,
> She sought to guide through darkest night.
> 
> Yet paths do twist, and stars do fade,
> Her vision lost in the shade she made.
> Gurth, our guide, our solemn friend,
> Her words did twist, did falsely bend.
> 
> In temples old, where silence reigns,
> Her legacy, a chain of pains.
> Once united, now apart,
> Her creed did tear our faith apart.
> 
> Oh Durashim, hear this plea,
> Let's bind our wounds, in unity.
> For Gurth is not just wrath and night,
> But also love, and guiding light.
> 
> So let us sing, a song of peace,
> For division and strife to cease.
> May Luthien's path, though astray,
> Lead us back to the dawn's first ray.
