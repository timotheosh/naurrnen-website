Nodus is a device made up of
1. Linker
2. Dilation module
3. Lorenza corrector
4. Kill switch

*** Linker
The Linker creates a quantum link between the caller and reciever, and particles are formed on the recieving end forming a completely particle replica of the caller. All bodily sensations such as hearing, seeing, touching, and tasting are transmitted to the reciever.

*** Dilation module
The dilation module dilates the time of the caller to that of the reciever. Only if time frames are synced can meaningful transmission take place. If time dilation is too great, the reciever can also use the dilation module to change their time dilation, forming a less disruptive time dilation medium for both participants. The need for this is rare, and is usually only needed for when traveling hyperspace or for terraform projects, when time dilation differences can sometimes be extreme, depending on the level of terraform progress.

*** Lorenza corrector
The Lorenza corrector can correct both sender and reciever time dilations in cases where such dilations fluctuate. Mostly during hyperspace travel. The Lorenza corrector is set with a max value, at which point the correction is abandoned. This can be necessary when unpredicted circumstances arise during communication.

*** The Kill switch
The kill switch is what disconnects the quantum link between sender and reciever. It activiates on hangup, which may occur when the Lorenza corrector has hit its max setting, or if harmful transmissions are made to the connected reciever from the other end. There is some linking between the communicator and the Kill switch that has to occur to make this possible.
