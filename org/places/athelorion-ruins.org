√Åyliaremma Elves made an ancient [[file:../history/first-era.org][Amearen]] ruin, now known as the Athelorion ruins, their capital city named Aeritha. [[file:../characters/bayetti-falasha.org][Bayetti Falasha]]'s [[file:../books/the-ancient-ones.org]["The Ancient Ones"]] speaks much of the ancient city, and is believed to have encrypted much of the ancient Elven knowledge of the Amearans in her poetic stanzas. There is a rumor that there is a vast transporter within that can leeds to the place of the dead.
