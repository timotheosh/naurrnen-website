- Background ::
The second era Elves did lay traps throughout the [[../places/athelorion-ruins.org][Athelorion]] underground passages, to dissuade others from discovering their secrets.
The third era elves are generally not as stingy, but the riddles of Falasha's writings are as much a mystery to them as they are to others.
There is an old, wise Hallashim, by the name of Faelinoril Galathil. He is the headmaster of the Transcript guild at [[../places/laurie-citime.org][Laurië Citime]]. He has dedicated most of his life trying to unravel Falasha's encrypted words and the secrets burried in the [[../places/athelorion-ruins.org][Athelorian ruins]].

Faelinoril's magnum ops, "[[../books/in-ayliaremmas-footsteps.org][In Áyliaremma's Footsteps]]", he reveals some the success the old elves had in translating enough of the [[../history/first-era.org][Amearan]] tongue to form some simple phrases. He further was able to cross-reference these phrases in Falasha's poems. This was a huge breakthrough in the research of the [[../history/first-era.org][Amearans]].
