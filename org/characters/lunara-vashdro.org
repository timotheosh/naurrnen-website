- Background ::
Orphaned at a tender age in the vastness of the Kaukloutan desert, the bustling markets of Ponte Cidade soon became Lunara's playground. Elias, with his tales of distant lands and thrilling adventures, played a pivotal role in shaping her childhood. Under his guidance, she not only absorbed the nuances of being a successful merchant but also honed her combat skills, mastering the bow and sword.

Elias's prowess as a marksman was legendary, and Lunara, with her insatiable thirst for knowledge, was a keen learner. The fluidity of her movements with the bow, the precision with which she struck, and her swordplay soon became the talk of the town.

As the years rolled by, the allure of Elias's bounty hunting escapades became irresistible for Lunara. The tales of danger, the promise of adventure, and the thrill of the chase beckoned her. At seventeen, with a blend of innocence and determination in her eyes, she pleaded with Elias to take her along on a bounty job. Seeing a reflection of his younger self in her fiery spirit, Elias relented.

Together, they embarked on journeys that tested their mettle, forging an unbreakable bond. Lunara's life was no longer just about discovering her Mochveneba lineage; it was also about embracing the life of adventure, risks, and rewards that came with being a merchant and bounty hunter in the grand Ponte Cidade.
