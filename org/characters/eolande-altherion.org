** Background
- Originally a scholar or legal advisor at the aelven court, Eolande fell from grace when his uncompromising interpretations of the law clashed with the more flexible ethics of the court.
- Exiled to a minor role as a groundskeeper at the eastern borders of the aelven empire, he retained only a small contingent of non-anashim slaves, one of whom was Thalion.

  Justiciar, if you do not obey the law, why do you call on others to do so? If the law is grand, as you surmise, it is grand to observe it. If you do not obey the law, it is you who have become the law breaker, and it is the duty of those who obey the law to disregard your authority. You have demoted yourself, you are the rebel, the renegade, not I.

  And with these words, the ruling Elder banished Eolanda Altherion from the court.
** Influence on Thalion Veyreth
- Eolande taught Thalion how to read and write, starting with the aelven laws that he revered so much.
- He instilled in Thalion the concept that laws should be both respected and held as the highest authority, even above rulers.
- His philosophy was based on the ancient laws as moral imperatives. This would be the cornerstone of Thalion's future work and the founding principles of the Archivist Guild.
- Eolande had fought in a skirmish in attempt to overcome one hundred Mochveneba warriors who had huddled behind the mighty walls of the Ornasion citidel. Eolanda's troops of several thousand seasoned aelven warriors were no match against the maurading warriors behind Ornasion's indistructable walls (which were of Amearan make, even though the inner citidel was clearly post-Amearan). Eolande told his story to Thalion, and even suggested he carry his resistance there, rather than risk being resold as slaves upon Eolande's death.
