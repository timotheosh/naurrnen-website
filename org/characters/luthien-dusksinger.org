-   *Background:*
Luthien Dusksingerâ€”her name now carries the echoes of twilight hymns and the whispers of secrecy. It's a name that suits her dual life: one in the light, helping and nurturing, and the other in the dusk, singing the songs of revolution and change. As the founder of the Veiled Thaerith, Luthien Dusksinger becomes a figure etched in the annals of Naurrnen's history, embodying the complex blend of empathy and strength necessary to lead a movement born from the depths of oppression.

An acolyte in training until the beginning of the Great Apostasy, Luthien was offered a spot in the new Hallashim rights for Gurth. Luthien refused, and was reduced to a housekeeper slave role.

on a day, while here oppressors are away on some business, a wounded Durashim boy comes crawling to her at the home she is working. She takes pity on the boy, and begins to bandage his wounds.

She learns that this is no boy at all, but a young man, just over the ripe age of 17. He was caught at the temple of Gurth, trying to steal a miniature statue. When he was caught, he tucked the statue under his cloak, and tried to make a run for it. His pursuers caught up to him, and beat him up badly. Leaving him for dead, they took the stolen statue back from him, and walked back to the temple.

The boy only wanted the statue so he could give the proper death rites for his sister, who was killed by some unruly Hallashim soldiers who wandered into his village, when she refused to allow them to have their way with her.

Luthien, moved by the boy's plight, tends to his wounds with a gentle yet firm touch, her heart heavy with the weight of his story. As she works, her mind races, each bandage wrapped not only a salve to his physical scars but a binding of her own resolve. She knows that the theft was not a mere act of defiance; it was a cry for justice, a desperate grasp at the traditions being stolen from them. This encounter stirs something within her, a call to action she can no longer ignore. In the quiet of the house, with only the soft groans of the boy breaking the silence, Luthien Dusksinger makes a vow. She will no longer stand aside as her people suffer; she will become the beacon in the darkness, guiding them back to the dignity and freedom they have been denied.

Luthien begins to think, how she can hide this boy from her taskmasters upon their return. She remembers a cove not far from where she is at, that she frequented as a young girl. It was a place, not even her parents knew. Thinking this to be the best possible option, for hiding the boy, and getting back to the house before her taskmasters return, she resolves to carry him to the cove. "I can always bring him food, water, and re-dress his bandages in the evenings."

On the second evening of bringing food, water, and bandages, Luthien asks the boy, "you are too young to perform those rites for death on your own. Where were you taking the statue?"

"I was taking it to my priest." said the boy.

"You have a priest?" Luthien inquired.

"Yes, he serves at the temple close to my village."

"Why couldn't he just use the statues at this temple?"

"The Hallashim took all our statutes, telling us we would not need them to perfomr the rites as they have written them. We're no longer allowed to perform the rites of our tradition."

"But your priest still does, if he has the proper tools?"

"Yes" the boy answered.

"You know, I was once an alcolyte in training before the Hallashim took everything away." stated Luthien.

"Would you be willing to risk death to carry your orders now?" asked the boy.

"Yes, I serve and love Gurth." answered Luthien.
