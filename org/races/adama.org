** Language
Men's language had been historically Hallashim, as man had been the slaves of certain High Anashim empires. But they did have a language of their own that differentiated them from their captors. That slave language evolved into a full-blown Adaman language or language of man. That language became known by the early third era as Malairt or "trade" language.
