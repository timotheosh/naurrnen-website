# The Transcript Guild: Preservers of Ancient Wisdom

> In the ink of the ancients, the state finds its roots; in the reverence of their spirit, it stands with unyielding bones. &#x2013; Valandur

While the Adama make no qualms for mass producing texts with its printing and lithography presses, the Hallishim pride themselves in handcrafted texts. They belive there is a certain transfer of life or spirituality in hand crafted facsimiles of the most ancient texts in the history of Naurrnen.

Headquarted in the [ancient Laurië Citime library](../Places/laurie-citime.md), the Transcript Guild serves as a vanguard for the conservation and duplication of some of the most ancient and irreplaceable texts known to civilization. This esteemed institution is a sanctuary for scribes, artists, and scholars dedicated to the meticulous art of transcribing ancient works. While many guilds focus on the creation of new knowledge, the Transcript Guild specializes in the preservation of old wisdom, ensuring that it survives the ravages of time and circumstance.

Apprentices undergo years of stringent training, learning not only the art of exacting transcription but also mastering the antiquated languages and deciphering complex symbols and images. Among the Hallishim, it&rsquo;s a widely accepted notion that a text loses half its value when the rich tapestry of its original presentation is lost. Lithography may be forbidden within the Kingdom of Tanquende, but the hand-crafted volumes produced by the guild are considered invaluable, not just for their content but for their artisanal quality.

The guild enjoys a special partnership with the Archivist Guild of Ornasion, often exchanging texts and discoveries to further the preservation of knowledge across Naurrnen. The Transcript Guild also holds a sacred duty to analyze the encrypted riddles and codes found in works like &ldquo;The Ameara&rdquo; by Bayetti Falasha, seeking keys to unlock the deep secrets of the past.

In essence, the Transcript Guild is more than a guild; it is a living link between past and future, a bridge that allows the wisdom of ancient civilizations to enlighten the minds of generations yet unborn.
