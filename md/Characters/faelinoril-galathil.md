-   **Age:** Elder
-   **Race:** Hallashim
-   **Occupation:** Head Master of the Hallashim Archiver&rsquo;s Guild
-   **Home:** Laurië Citime, in the city of Tanquende
-   **Eneagram Scale:** Investigator
-   **Background:** 

The second era Elves did lay traps throughout the [Athelorion](../Places/athelorion-ruins.md) underground passages, to dissuade others from discovering their secrets.
The third era elves are generally not as stingy, but the riddles of Falasha&rsquo;s writings are as much a mystery to them as they are to others.
There is an old, wise Hallashim, by the name of Faelinoril Galathil. He is the headmaster of the Transcript guild at [Laurië Citime](../Places/laurie-citime.md). He has dedicated most of his life trying to unravel Falasha&rsquo;s encrypted words and the secrets burried in the [Athelorian ruins](../Places/athelorion-ruins.md).

Faelinoril&rsquo;s magnum ops, &ldquo;[In Áyliaremma&rsquo;s Footsteps](../Books/in-ayliaremmas-footsteps.md)&rdquo;, he reveals some the success the old elves had in translating enough of the [Amearan](../History/first-era.md) tongue to form some simple phrases. He further was able to cross-reference these phrases in Falasha&rsquo;s poems. This was a huge breakthrough in the research of the [Amearans](../History/first-era.md).
