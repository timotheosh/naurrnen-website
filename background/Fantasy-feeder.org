* The World of Naurrnen
** History
*** Eras
**** First Era .... -  1999
***** Pre-recorded History to the first histories
This is Naurrnen's pre-history. It is often referred to in reference to histories and oral traditions that date earlier than when the first recorded era began. Some time, during this era, was the time of the Amearans, or "the ancient ones". A civilization that is believed to have been far more advanced technologically and magically than any civilization after it. So much so, that many believe they were gods or sent from the gods. No one knows what became of them. Many believe they were swooped up into the seventh heaven, upon completing their bidding for the gods. They left what remains of their ancient civilization to teach the people of Naurrnen wisdom and the nature of the gods. But they wrote in a script not familiar to anyone.
**** Second Era 2000 - 4000
***** Eleven Empire(s)
The High Elves of Áyliaremma (the two trees) united the various tribes into nation states, and then into mighty empires. They were skilled linguists and managed to discover enough of the ancient Amearan language to form a crude understanding of some simple terms that may or may not be accurate translations. They did the best they could without a Philosopher's stone, and advanced Naurrnen's understanding of the language further than any other culture in history.
The Elves of Áyliaremma made some great archeological discoveries of Amearan technology and lore (including the deciphering of some Amerean script), but wanted to keep this knowledge from other races on Naurrnen, whom they had enslaved for most of this period.
The most dominant of the Elven empires was Aerithia.
The Elves of Áyliaremma desired to both preserve what they learned from the Amearans, and encrypt what they have learned to keep their secrets from being learned by the other races. One of the most famous tomes, was title "The Ameara" or the "The Ancient Ones". In it is found a mixture of intriguing historical antedotes that may or may not be correct, tripe geographic details mixed with obscure poetry. The poetry is said to contain the secrets of the Amearans that the Elves had learned. Falashas cryptic messages are just as lost to the Elves of the third era, as it is to all the other races.
Bayetti Falasha was an elven scholar, dated as far back as the early second era. She was a court scholar of the great Elven empire. She wrote many books on philosophy and poetry that are still used extensively and held in the highest regard amongst Elven folk. Bayetti is, perhaps, the best known scholar of Naurnen's ancient history.
***** Decline of a mighty empire
Elira Naethanor, an esteemed elf of the Eärendelion lineage in Áyliaremma, and Cormac Naethanor, an Adama slave under Aerithia's reign, both served pivotal roles in the downfall of the Elven Empire. Their clandestine relationship, which blossomed at Laurië Citime, led them to question the empire's oppressive ethics. Risking persecution, they united their intellectual and revolutionary passions, joining a larger movement aimed at emancipating slaves and political prisoners. Their combined defiance and strategies not only labeled them as traitors but also spearheaded the rise of the Gran Imperio, a pluralistic realm that replaced the Elven hegemony and reshaped Naurrnen's historical trajectory.
**** Third Era 4000 - 5000+

***** Empire of man
The beginning of the reign of man. Men superseded elves, and in doing so, try to build a more pluralistic society, incorporating all races, but unifying them under man's religion.
** Races
*** Primary Races
The races within Naurrnen are fairly equal. Although Elves are known for their skills in magic, music, and crafting instruments and enchanted items, that does not mean one will find elves doing hard labor, exercising what strength they have. Orcs are generally favored for that sort of labor, as they tend to be more physically suited for the task. But not every Orc is physically built for this task, as not every Elf is well suited to the arts. Their are Orcs who take an interest in magic or music, as well. They are generally not as well suited as the Elves, but that is not to say, their are not Orcs that have better ears, or eyes than many Elves, or better minds for magic. These exceptions are generally blamed on half-breeds. Half-breeding has become so common in the age of man, no one really knows for sure who is a half-breed, or if one, who might think themselves as a pure-bred, is really a fourth or fifth generation mixed breed. What separates the races more than anything are their cultural identities.

Men's language had been historically Hallashim, as man had been the slaves of certain High Elf empires. But they did have a language of their own that differentiated them from their captors.

*** Secondary Races
**** Mochveneba
Mochveneba or "ghost people" are a minority ethnicity within Naurrnen. They are elf-like, in that they share many of the features that elven folk have, but they are well known for their physical prowness. Their skin is a deep red, with stripes. Similar to tiger stripes. In fact, legend outside the Mochveneba tribes, say they are crossbred elves with tigers. In reality, they are more than likely half-breeds. More than likely, half-elf, and half-something else. They have unusual stamina, so some speculate half-orc, though their uncommon beauty seems to indicate otherwise.

The Mochveneba tribes are religious, and perhaps to most of the civilized world, somewhat superstitious. Mochveneba are spiritual and do not generally pursue material wealth. Those that do, are coveted for their beauty and brute strength.
***** Strengths
1. Enchanting weapons and items.
2. Known for physical strength.
3. Warlike, but peace-loving.
***** Pantheon
Belief system comprises of the following
1. Animism: They believe spirit is in all things. But they also believe that consciousness is a higher form of spirit.
2. Believe in balance betweem "pah" and "foh". Good/Evil. Hot/Cold, etc.
3. Believe their ancestors live beyond the vale, and they will one day join them in death.
4. Presence, meditation, seeking inner peace and clarity is essential. Past and future, do not matter. Only the present.
5. Cycle of life:  spirit lives and dies, and is renewed again. Consciousness, on the other hand, goes to the ancestral grove, the spirit world, after death, and does not return.

**** Providential Libraries
***** Ornasion, Gran Imperio
This is the largest library in Naurrnen. It consists of a large citidel, with a castle and towers. It is primarily run by the Gran Imperio's Archivist Guild. The citidel consists of thousands of rooms deep under the surface of the city, and far into the chambers above the ground. Most of the transcriptions of the ancient books in Laurië Citime have been purchased and stored at this library.
****** The Archivist Guild: Guardians of Knowledge
The Archivist Guild is the esteemed institution that serves as the backbone of Ornasion, the Citadel of Wisdom. Established in antiquity, this guild is a collective of the realm's most distinguished scholars, librarians, and documentarians whose primary mission is to preserve, catalog, and disseminate the vast reserves of knowledge stored within the city. With a focus that transcends mere bookkeeping, the Archivist Guild is committed to the promotion of intellectual curiosity and scholarly exchange across all disciplines.

Members of the guild undergo rigorous training in disciplines ranging from archival science to arcane arts, ensuring they possess the expertise required to maintain the complex web of knowledge housed in Ornasion. These archivists are more than just caretakers; they are mentors, guiding young scholars through the labyrinthine corridors of wisdom, and acting as mediators in intellectual debates and forums.

Once a year, the guild organizes the "Conclave of Quills," an international symposium that invites scholars, historians, and researchers from far and wide to present their work, fostering an environment of academic collaboration and groundbreaking discoveries.


Additionally, the guild employs an elite force of mage-guards specially trained to safeguard the invaluable treasures of Ornasion. Utilizing a unique blend of martial skill and arcane knowledge, these mage-guards ensure the sanctity and security of one of Naurrnen's most invaluable resources.

The Archivist Guild is not just an organization; it's a living testament to Naurrnen’s commitment to the pursuit of knowledge. Through its ceaseless efforts, the guild ensures that the flame of intellectual inquiry continues to burn bright for future generations.

**** Laurië Citime, Kingdon of Tanquende (Capital of Tanquende)
One of the oldest libraries in Naurrnen. Contains some of the oldest volumes known to civilization. There is also the largest Transcript guild within the city. The Transcript guild tries to make exact copies of the most ancient books within the library in an effort to preserve the books. They also make copies available to the printing presses, but these are considered inferior to the original books. Symbols, pictures, and sketches are of equal value to the printed word, and a book with just the printed word, contains only half the worth of the original. Lithography has been strictly prohibited within the Kingdom of Tanquende, so mass producing images in these arcane books are not currently legally possible. This also artificially inflates the value of the book copies made by the Transcript guilds.
***** The Transcript Guild: Preservers of Ancient Wisdom
Nestled in the heart of Laurië Citime, the Transcript Guild serves as a vanguard for the conservation and duplication of some of the most ancient and irreplaceable texts known to civilization. This esteemed institution is a sanctuary for scribes, artists, and scholars dedicated to the meticulous art of transcribing ancient works. While many guilds focus on the creation of new knowledge, the Transcript Guild specializes in the preservation of old wisdom, ensuring that it survives the ravages of time and circumstance.

Apprentices undergo years of stringent training, learning not only the art of exacting transcription but also mastering the antiquated languages and deciphering complex symbols and images. Among the Hallishim, it's a widely accepted notion that a text loses half its value when the rich tapestry of its original presentation is lost. Lithography may be forbidden within the Kingdom of Tanquende, but the hand-crafted volumes produced by the guild are considered invaluable, not just for their content but for their artisanal quality.

The guild enjoys a special partnership with the Archivist Guild of Ornasion, often exchanging texts and discoveries to further the preservation of knowledge across Naurrnen. The Transcript Guild also holds a sacred duty to analyze the encrypted riddles and codes found in works like "The Ameara" by Bayetti Falasha, seeking keys to unlock the deep secrets of the past.

In essence, the Transcript Guild is more than a guild; it is a living link between past and future, a bridge that allows the wisdom of ancient civilizations to enlighten the minds of generations yet unborn.
