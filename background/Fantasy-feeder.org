* The World of Naurrnen
** History
*** Eras
**** First Era .... -  1999
***** Pre-recorded History to the first histories
This is Naurrnen's pre-history. It is often referred to in reference to histories and oral traditions that date earlier than when the first recorded era began. Some time, during this era, was the time of the Amearans, or "the ancient ones". A civilization that is believed to have been far more advanced technologically and magically than any civilization after it. So much so, that many believe they were gods or sent from the gods. No one knows what became of them. Many believe they were swooped up into the seventh heaven, upon completing their bidding for the gods. They left what remains of their ancient civilization to teach the people of Naurrnen wisdom and the nature of the gods. But they wrote in a script not familiar to anyone.
**** Second Era 2000 - 4000
***** Eleven Empire(s)

The Second Era in the annals of Naurrnen's history is often seen as a transformational period. Known as the Age of Hallashim Ascendancy, it was a time when High Aelves of Áyliaremma rose to unparalleled heights of intellectual, magical, and martial prowess. The High Aelves of Áyliaremma united the various tribes into nation states, and then into mighty empires. The early years, the Áyliaremma Aelves were primarilly concerned with law. If they could find hints of the law of the Amearans, and decipher them, it was thought, they could build a great and just empire.

Because of their obsession with civil law, the Áyliaremma Aelves became masterful linguists, pursuing the elusive Amearan tongue with a level of scholarly intensity unmatched in the realms of Naurrnen. With no existing Rosetta Stone to guide them, their efforts were nevertheless considerable. They spent decades poring over fragmented manuscripts, lost carvings, and puzzling artifacts, managing to develop the most detailed understanding of the ancient language ever achieved.

One of the "discoveries" of the second era, was an etched stone, found in one of the Amearan ruins, that pictured Anashim with an enscription that was translated "Aelves". The name stuck for scholars of the third era. Anashim are "Aelves" according to the translation of the etched stone. There is ongoing debate on validity of that translation.

While the Áyliaremma Aelves were scholars and linguists, they were also explorers and archaeologists, driven by an insatiable curiosity to uncover the forgotten treasures of the Amearan civilization. Several notable archaeological finds were attributed to their expeditions. Among them were mysterious relics of magic and lore, some of which hinted at levels of advancement far beyond the grasp of even the most enlightened Hallashim minds.

The most dominant of the Anashim empires was Aerithia. It arose at first with its dedication to designing just laws. The law held special religious importance as well. A great society, it was thought, could arise, if it held its laws, as imperfect as they might be, in the highest regard for all. This also meant that a ruler was, like his subjects, under the law. If the ruler broke the law, he/sh was no longer a legitimate ruler for the realm. It is held by many scholars that this primacy of law by the Aeritha empire is what led it to greatness.

***** Absolutism
A clever and well connected statesman, by the name of Eldacar, began endorsing and employing his closest friends and allies, most of whom where his closest childhood friends. He created government positions for these friends, and slowly started to replace the current senate with them. They were young, ambitious, and cruel. The Aeritha laws encouraged, and even demanded that they share their discoveries with their brethren and the other races. At some uncertain point in time, it was decided by the senate that this sharing was no longer going to happen. The rulers of Aeritha became obsessed with discovery, and began forfeiting their regard for its laws. Eldacar, with the senate that had then become mostly populated by his childhood friends, became an absolute monarch of Aeritha. Eldacar, with support of his senate, began enslaving non-Aelven races.

The result was devastating. The discoveries that were found, were treated with the utmost secrecy, sheltered in hidden vaults and elite academic circles to prevent other races from gleaning their secrets. This form of academic elitism was symptomatic of a broader societal stratification that pervaded the mid-Second Era.

Militarily and politically, Aerithia stood as the zenith of Hallashim civilization during this age. Rooted in its rich academic tradition and fueled by its archaeological discoveries, Aerithia developed magical technologies that were instrumental in its eventual dominion over other Hallashim empires. Its armies were legendary, its magicians unparalleled, and its rulers both cunning and visionary. Under Aerithian rule, the disparate Hallashim nation-states were welded into a single, formidable empire. The capital, resplendent in its grandeur, became the heart of Naurrnen, a seat of power, wisdom, and unfortunately, inequality.

***** The Great Apostasy
The fall of the great empire is said to have begun around the last three hundred years of the second era. The age of the Great Apostasy. The infamous, and paranoid monarch, Serinwe, rose to power, and begun enslaving the other Anashim. It was also around this time that the great Justicier Eolande Altherion challenged the courts and the corrupt rulers of Aeritha. He was exiled for his trouble, but Altherion was extremely resourceful, as he became a key component of the beginnings of solid resistance. He tought one of his slaves, Thalion Veyreth, how to read and write. He taught him in all the ancient laws of the Aelves, and then freed him on his death bed. Thalion Veyreth was the founder of the Moonlight Path, the famous underground resistance that helped fuel the Naethanor revolution a few hundred years later.

***** Decline of a mighty empire
Elira Naethanor, an esteemed Hallashim of the Eärendelion lineage in Áyliaremma, and Cormac Naethanor, an Adama slave under Aerithia's reign, both served pivotal roles in the downfall of the Anashim Empire. Their clandestine relationship, which blossomed at Laurië Citime, led them to question the empire's oppressive ethics. Risking persecution, they united their intellectual and revolutionary passions, joining a larger movement aimed at emancipating slaves and political prisoners. Their combined defiance and strategies not only labeled them as traitors but also spearheaded the rise of the Gran Imperio, a pluralistic realm that replaced the Anashim hegemony and reshaped Naurrnen's historical trajectory.
**** Third Era 4000 - 5000+

***** Empire of man
The beginning of the reign of man. Men superseded elves, and in doing so, try to build a more pluralistic society, incorporating all races, but unifying them under man's religion.
** Races
*** Primary Races
The races within Naurrnen are fairly equal. Although Aelves are known for their skills in magic, music, and crafting instruments and enchanted items, that does not mean one will find elves doing hard labor, exercising what strength they have. Orcs are generally favored for that sort of labor, as they tend to be more physically suited for the task. But not every Orc is physically built for this task, as not every Aelf is well suited to the arts. Their are Orcs who take an interest in magic or music, as well. They are generally not as well suited as the Aelves, but that is not to say, their are not Orcs that have better ears, or eyes than many Aelves, or better minds for magic. These exceptions are generally blamed on half-breeds. Half-breeding has become so common in the age of man, no one really knows for sure who is a half-breed, or if one, who might think themselves as a pure-bred, is really a fourth or fifth generation mixed breed. What separates the races more than anything are their cultural identities.

***** Pantheon
| *Anor*   | Highest father of vengeance.                    |
| *Ithil*  | Highest mother of justice. The great protector. |
| *Gladys* | Goddess of nature.                              |
| *Gurth*  | God of the underworld. Friend of the dead.      |
| *Nostia* | Goddess of fertility.                           |

*** Hallashim: Anor and Ithil
Caretakers of the highest father and mother's temples and places of worship are taken very seriously among the Hallashim. What comes with this care, and stewardship, on behalf og the other Anashim, sometimes, and arrogant supremacy. The Hallashim are a proud and majestic race, but also one that must overcome some of the justifiable prejudice and bitterness that arose from their mighty empire in the second era. The god titles are also borne by the ruling Hallashim emperor or emperess.

*** Taurashim: Gladys and Nostia
Nature and nurture. The Taurashim take as their own, the care and growth for the other Anashim races. The Taurashim are known for their annual festivals, where the three hordes of the Taurashim teach and train the other hordes in areas where their students, by the cultural limitations, are in need of training. They see this their duty to offer these same services to their neighboring Anashim. Others do come, but rarely, are these "others" noblemen or women or anyone of high social status within their own home nation.

*** Durashim: Gurth and Nostia
The cult of Gurth and Nostia, is a recognition of the cycle of life and death. Unlike their Anashim brothers, the Durashim take ancestral recognition above and beyond the other races. Fear of death is seen as almost sacreligious. But so is the fear of life. The Durashim hold bravery, and loyalty very highly. At least for all those within the mainline cult of Gurth and Nostia.

**** Adama or Man
***** Language
Men's language had been historically Hallashim, as man had been the slaves of certain High Aelf empires. But they did have a language of their own that differentiated them from their captors. That slave language evolved into a full-blown Adaman language or language of man. That language became known by the early third era as Malairt or "trade" language.

*** Secondary Races
**** Mochveneba
Mochveneba or "ghost people" are a minority ethnicity within Naurrnen. They are Aelf-like, in that they share many of the features that elven folk have, but they are well known for their physical prowness. Their skin is a deep red, with stripes. Similar to tiger stripes. In fact, legend outside the Mochveneba tribes, say they are crossbred elves with tigers. In reality, they are more than likely half-breeds. More than likely, half-Aelf, and half-something else. They have unusual stamina, so some speculate half-orc, though their uncommon beauty seems to indicate otherwise.

The Mochveneba tribes are religious, and perhaps to most of the civilized world, somewhat superstitious. Mochveneba are spiritual and do not generally pursue material wealth. Those that do, are coveted for their beauty and brute strength.
***** Strengths
1. Enchanting weapons and items.
2. Known for physical strength.
3. Warlike, but peace-loving.
***** Pantheon
Belief system comprises of the following
1. Animism: They believe spirit is in all things. But they also believe that consciousness is a higher form of spirit.
2. Believe in balance betweem "pah" and "foh". Good/Evil. Hot/Cold, etc.
3. Believe their ancestors live beyond the vale, and they will one day join them in death.
4. Presence, meditation, seeking inner peace and clarity is essential. Past and future, do not matter. Only the present.
5. Cycle of life:  spirit lives and dies, and is renewed again. Consciousness, on the other hand, goes to the ancestral grove, the spirit world, after death, and does not return.
