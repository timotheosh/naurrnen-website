<blockquote>
<p>
In shadows deep, where whispers dwell,
Luthien walked, her tale to tell.
With heart so pure, intentions bright,
She sought to guide through darkest night.
</p>

<p>
Yet paths do twist, and stars do fade,
Her vision lost in the shade she made.
Gurth, our guide, our solemn friend,
Her words did twist, did falsely bend.
</p>

<p>
In temples old, where silence reigns,
Her legacy, a chain of pains.
Once united, now apart,
Her creed did tear our faith apart.
</p>

<p>
Oh Durashim, hear this plea,
Let&rsquo;s bind our wounds, in unity.
For Gurth is not just wrath and night,
But also love, and guiding light.
</p>

<p>
So let us sing, a song of peace,
For division and strife to cease.
May Luthien&rsquo;s path, though astray,
Lead us back to the dawn&rsquo;s first ray.
</p>
