<p>
The Second Era in the annals of Naurrnen&rsquo;s history is often seen as a transformational period. Known as the Age of Hallashim Ascendancy, it was a time when High Aelves of Áyliaremma rose to unparalleled heights of intellectual, magical, and martial prowess. The High Aelves of Áyliaremma united the various tribes into nation states, and then into mighty empires. The early years, the Áyliaremma Aelves were primarilly concerned with law. If they could find hints of the law of the Amearans, and decipher them, it was thought, they could build a large just empire.
</p>

<p>
Because of their obsession with civil law, the Áyliaremma Aelves became masterful linguists, pursuing the elusive Amearan tongue with a level of scholarly intensity unmatched in the realms of Naurrnen. With no existing Rosetta Stone to guide them, their efforts were nevertheless considerable. They spent decades poring over fragmented manuscripts, lost carvings, and puzzling artifacts, managing to develop the most detailed understanding of the ancient language ever achieved. However, one must remember that their expertise, while monumental, was built on imperfect foundations. Their translations were educated guesses at best, lending a mysterious air of uncertainty to all things Amearan.
</p>

<p>
One of the &ldquo;discoveries&rdquo; of the second era, was an etched stone, found in one of the Amearan ruins, that pictured Anashim with an enscription that was translated &ldquo;Aelves&rdquo;. The name stuck for scholars of the third era. Anashim are &ldquo;Aelves&rdquo; according to the translation of the etched stone. There is ongoing debate on validity of that translation.
</p>

<p>
While the Áyliaremma Aelves were scholars and linguists, they were also explorers and archaeologists, driven by an insatiable curiosity to uncover the forgotten treasures of the Amearan civilization. Several notable archaeological finds were attributed to their expeditions. Among them were mysterious relics of technology and lore, some of which hinted at levels of advancement far beyond the grasp of even the most enlightened Hallashim minds.
</p>

<p>
The most dominant of the Anashim empires was Aerithia. It arose at first with its dedication to designing just laws. The law held special religious importance as well. A great society, it was thought, could arise, if it held its laws, as imperfect as they might be, in the highest regard for all. This also meant that a ruler was, like his subjects, under the law. If the ruler broke the law, he/sh was no longer a legitimate ruler for the realm. It is held by many scholars that this primacy of law by the Aeritha empire is what led it to greatness.
</p>

<p>
Fear began to grip those in power. Their laws encouraged, and even demanded that they share their discoveries with their brethren and the other races. At some uncertain point in time, it was decided that this sharing was no longer going to happen. The rulers of Aeritha became obsessed with discovery, and began forfeiting their regard for its laws.
</p>

<p>
The result was devastating. The discoveries that were found, were treated with the utmost secrecy, sheltered in hidden vaults and elite academic circles to prevent other races from gleaning their secrets. This form of academic elitism was symptomatic of a broader societal stratification that pervaded the mid-Second Era.
</p>

<p>
Militarily and politically, Aerithia stood as the zenith of Hallashim civilization during this age. Rooted in its rich academic tradition and fueled by its archaeological discoveries, Aerithia developed magical technologies that were instrumental in its eventual dominion over other Hallashim empires. Its armies were legendary, its magicians unparalleled, and its rulers both cunning and visionary. Under Aerithian rule, the disparate Hallashim nation-states were welded into a single, formidable empire. The capital, resplendent in its grandeur, became the heart of Naurrnen, a seat of power, wisdom, and unfortunately, inequality.
</p>

<p>
For beneath the shining accomplishments of the latter discovery-seeking Aerithian Aelves lay a more somber reality. The empire was transforming to that of a slave empire. First, they enslaved non-Aelven races, denied them access to education, magic, and any form of social upward mobility. While the Aelves reveled in their discoveries and advancements, the subjugated peoples languished in chains, both literal and metaphorical.
</p>

<p>
The Aelves of Áyliaremma desired to both preserve what they learned from the Amearans, and encrypt what they have learned to keep their secrets from being learned by the other races. One of the most famous tomes, was title &ldquo;The Ameara&rdquo; or the &ldquo;The Ancient Ones&rdquo;. In it is found a mixture of intriguing historical antedotes that may or may not be correct, tripe geographic details mixed with obscure poetry. The poetry is said to contain the secrets of the Amearans that the Aelves had learned. Falashas cryptic messages are just as lost to the Aelves of the third era, as it is to all the other races.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../characters/bayetti-falasha.html">Bayetti Falasha</a> was an elven scholar, dated as far back as the early to mid second era. She was a court scholar of the great Aeritha empire. She wrote many books on philosophy and poetry that are still used extensively and held in the highest regard amongst Anashim folk. Bayetti is, perhaps, the best known scholar of Naurnen&rsquo;s ancient history.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-the-great-apostasy-of-3695">
<p>
In the year 3695, a pivotal moment unfolded in the history of the Aeritha Aelves as a particular leader, whose ambition was only eclipsed by his cunning, ascended the throne of Aeritha. This leader, known for his charismatic yet tyrannical rule, abolished the ancient laws that upheld fairness and equity and, most crucially, kept the ruler subject to the same laws as the governed. In its place, he established a new doctrine of governance: the absolute power of the ruling council, effectively marking the beginning of an era of absolutism in Aeritha.
</p>

<p>
As the non-Hallashim Aelves began to protest this abrupt usurpation of power and the dismantling of their cherished legal traditions, the ruler&rsquo;s response was swift and severe. He expanded his autocratic reach into the spiritual realm, asserting dominion over the religious rites of all Aelves. The worship of the pantheon, once diverse and reflective of the various Aelven cultures, was now to be standardized and controlled exclusively according to the dictates of the council of Aeritha. This usurpation was not only a political maneuver but also a profound spiritual violation, deeply wounding the cultural and religious identity of all Aelves.
</p>

<p>
The enslavement of the other Anashim races began in earnest, a grim and tangible symbol of the new order&rsquo;s cruelty and disregard for the sanctity of freedom and individual rights. It was during this dark time that the great <a href="../characters/eolande-altherion.html">Justicier Eolande Altherion</a>, a figure of justice and law, boldly challenged the corrupt courts and rulers of Aeritha. His defiance, while noble, led to his exile, marking him as an enemy of the state but a beacon of hope for the oppressed.
</p>

<p>
Exiled but undeterred, Altherion&rsquo;s influence continued to grow. He became an architect of resistance, teaching his knowledge and wisdom to those who would listen. Among those was a young slave, <a href="../characters/thalion-veyreth.html">Thalion Veyreth</a>, whom Altherion taught to read and write, imbuing him with the ancient laws and ideals of the Aelves. On his deathbed, Altherion granted Thalion his freedom, a final act of defiance and hope. Thalion Veyreth, inspired and equipped by Altherion&rsquo;s teachings, went on to found the Moonlight Path, an underground network of resistance that would become the heartbeat of the <a href="../characters/legend-of-naethanor.html">Naethanor revolution</a> centuries later.
</p>

<p>
This period, known ever after as the Great Apostasy, was characterized by tyranny, spiritual suppression, and the erosion of ancient liberties. Yet, it also planted the seeds of eventual resistance and revolution, as the oppressed clung to the memories of freedom and justice, awaiting the day they would reclaim their rightful heritage.
