In the heart of Naurrnen lies the Gran Imperio, often referred to as the &ldquo;human empire.&rdquo; However, it&rsquo;s a realm that defies easy classification, as it embodies true pluralism and inclusivity, welcoming various races and cultures within its borders.

Several hundred kilometers to the south of <a href="../Places/ponte-cidade.html">Ponte Cidade</a>, one finds the awe-inspiring <a href="../Places/Ornasion library.html">Ornasion library</a>, a citadel of knowledge unparalleled in its grandeur. Ornasion is the largest library in all of Naurrnen, housing an extensive collection of texts, manuscripts, and scrolls from various ages and civilizations. Within its hallowed halls, seekers of wisdom and enlightenment can delve into the vast reservoir of human and non-human knowledge, uncovering the secrets of history, magic, and philosophy.
