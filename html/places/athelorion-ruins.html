√Åyliaremma Elves made an ancient <a href="../history/first-era.html">Amearen</a> ruin, now known as the Athelorion ruins, their capital city named Aeritha. <a href="../characters/bayetti-falasha.html">Bayetti Falasha</a>&rsquo;s <a href="../books/the-ancient-ones.html">&ldquo;The Ancient Ones&rdquo;</a> speaks much of the ancient city, and is believed to have encrypted much of the ancient Elven knowledge of the Amearans in her poetic stanzas. There is a rumor that there is a vast transporter within that can leeds to the place of the dead.
