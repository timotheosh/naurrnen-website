Elias Vorndur, an Edama Archive Guild scholar from Ornasion, set up a team of scholars and explorers to investigate a portal in one of the ancient Amearen cities in the Kaukloutan desert, called Aurunian, which layed just north of the mountains that separate the jungles of Vilesia and the Kouklatan desert, and also several pisecs north of Siyam Nagasi, the capital city of the Principality of Vilesia. The portal is said to be one that reaches the heavenly realm of the gods. The last expidition there had taken place several hundred years ago, and even though the party returned mostly intact, very little was actually recorded in what they found. Elias was going to put this mystery to rest, once and for all.

The party travels several stories underground before reaching the portal. They open their tomes of what is known of the ancient Amearan tongue and after several days, figure out how to activate the portal. Blue light shimmering the darknes and swirling around the portal&rsquo;s entrance, the party steps through to the other side. They enter a room made of metal, and lights that required no candle wax or oil. The windows of the room appeared to be viewing ports into the heavens. They could see spheres in the celestial realm, including Ora, the giant sphere in Naurrnen&rsquo;s sky, some of whom call &ldquo;moon&rdquo; and Naurrnen&rsquo;s two suns, like bright disks, yet darkness all around them, like something in the heavens was immune to their light, even though they appeared brighter than they did from Naurrnen.

Walking further down the hall in this metal room, they found a throne that looked more like designed for function rather than for glorious majesty. They noticed the Amearan runes eched in the arm of the throne. Elias looked up at the other party members with a knowing smile, &ldquo;this&#x2026; oh, this!&rdquo; He remembered one of the ancient Amearan cantations that he had spent most of his career deciphering, and with a click of a button, the throne moned into life. Light and switches on the throne came to life. Ellias eager to try this unique device, sat on the throne, entered an Amearan script he had prepared for this moment, and then&#x2026;. the spherical door, encloses around the throne encaseing Elias in the chair. A view port in front of him, enables to view the others from his expidition. But they are not moving normally, but they suddenly appear to be moving very fast. Inhumanly fast. They look like they are trying to fre Elias from the sphere, but they are moving far too fast. Wait, where are they going? &ldquo;They are leaving me here!? Why?&rdquo;

Elias&rsquo; panic is interrupted as he seems to have transported somewhere away from his spherical trap. But he is also no longer alone. He observes two Adama men wearing clothing he has never seen before. They were both wearing the same outfit and had goggles on their foreheads. &ldquo;Hello? Who are you?&rdquo; asked Elias. The men stopped what they were doing and turned to look at Elias with a rather astonished look on their faces. They responded, seemingly friendly, but Elias could not understand what they were saying.
</p>

<p>
One of the two men called out, and a third man appears with white hair and red skin. &ldquo;Hello sir, how can I help you?&rdquo; the man asked Elias in his own tongue. Elias responded, &ldquo;I some how came to a portal and teleported here. Where am I?&rdquo; &ldquo;A portal, you say? Where are you hailing from?&rdquo; &ldquo;I come from the Ornassion Library in the Gran Imperio.&rdquo; The man responded with a puzzled look, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of the Ornassion library, and since when did an empire come about?&rdquo; The white haried man motioned to the other two men who then start working on there contraptions in from of them. The white haried man remained silent and waited for the two men to answer his inquiry. When they responded , all the color in white haired man&rsquo;s face drained. He was speechless. Elias breaks the silence, &ldquo;can you tell me where I am?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, we located you.&rdquo; said the white haired man. &ldquo;Located me? but I am right here!&rdquo; Elias said. &ldquo;Ah, yes, your um&#x2026; conscienciousness is here, and everything you see and feel is here, but you are still in the sphere you walked into in your home-land. But don&rsquo;t worry lad, we have lopcated where that is, and am sending a rescue crew that should be there in a couple tarsects.&rdquo; Elias responded, &ldquo; what is &lsquo;tarsects&rsquo;?&rdquo; White haired man replied,  &ldquo;I am sorry, they should be there shortly. But while you are waiting for them, I&rsquo;ll keep you company until we sort this all out.&rdquo;

Elias had found, and managed to activate a Nodus communicator. His &ldquo;throne&rdquo; is a comfortable, ergonomic chair, and once activated, it preps the user for interstellar communication. The Nodus chair will enclose into a sphere, and time is slowed down to that of Setsefar standard dilation rate (100). He is then linked quantumly with his body, where he appears as himself to the reciever, and is able to see, touch, and taste remotely in the place he communicates to. He doesn&rsquo;t teleport anywhere and is still in that chair. Elias can&rsquo;t know this, not knowing the nature of the device.
</p>

<p>
The Setsafar engineers were able to locate where Elias&rsquo; transmission was coming from and are able to rescue hime be sending a ship to his coordinates using a worm hole generator.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Return to home, several months have gone by since his entrapment. He can talk about his experience with whomever he wants at his leisure, but he, nor anyone else in Naurrnen will be able to communicate with anyone in Setsafar as he did. Now that they have found the missing project, they have elected to take a strict non-intervention policy. They will run maintence on needed systems to keep the planet going, but will not interact with anyone from Naurrnen.</li>
<li>Stay with Setsafar - This means, Elias can never go back home. He will become an official citizen and can study whatever he wants, but he cannot communicate with anyone from his home planet.</li>

<p>
He stays with Setsafar. All the other Nodus communicators are disabled. They do perform maintenance on the portals in hopes that one day Naurrnen will grow up enough to become curious about space.
