The second era Elves did lay traps throughout the <a href="../places/athelorion-ruins.html">Athelorion</a> underground passages, to dissuade others from discovering their secrets.
The third era elves are generally not as stingy, but the riddles of Falasha&rsquo;s writings are as much a mystery to them as they are to others.
There is an old, wise Hallashim, by the name of Faelinoril Galathil. He is the headmaster of the Transcript guild at <a href="../places/laurie-citime.html">Laurië Citime</a>. He has dedicated most of his life trying to unravel Falasha&rsquo;s encrypted words and the secrets burried in the <a href="../places/athelorion-ruins.html">Athelorian ruins</a>.
</p>

<p>
Faelinoril&rsquo;s magnum ops, &ldquo;<a href="../books/in-ayliaremmas-footsteps.html">In Áyliaremma&rsquo;s Footsteps</a>&rdquo;, he reveals some the success the old elves had in translating enough of the <a href="../history/first-era.html">Amearan</a> tongue to form some simple phrases. He further was able to cross-reference these phrases in Falasha&rsquo;s poems. This was a huge breakthrough in the research of the <a href="../history/first-era.html">Amearans</a>.
