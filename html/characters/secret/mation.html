<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-background">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Cultural Origin:</b> Of the Edama (Red Men) race, the most common within the Gran Imperio. From the Gran Imperio, specifically a scholar trained in the Archiver&rsquo;s Guild within the great Ornassion Library.</li>
<li><b>Occupation/Status:</b> Scholar, devoted to the pursuit of knowledge and history. Highly respected within academic circles but often seen as aloof by peers.</li>
<li><b>Family/Relationships:</b> Estranged from family due to his obsessive scholarly pursuits. Few close relationships, but maintains a mentor-student dynamic with senior Archivers.</li>
<li><b>Unique Backstory:</b> His &ldquo;gnostic by practice&rdquo; approach shapes his life; he often neglects his physical needs, becoming so absorbed in his studies that he &ldquo;forgets&rdquo; he has a body. His obsession with unraveling the secrets of Amearan artifacts has led to several breakthroughs, but also personal isolation. He also served in the military for the Gran Imperio, training as a spearman, cavalryman, and finally as a man-at-arms. While adequate with weapons, he found a preference for unarmed combat and has pursued physical excellence within that context. His commitment to honing this skill has led him to undertake trips into the desert to train with the Mochveneba, the people of the desert, learning their unique martial techniques and philosophies.</li>
